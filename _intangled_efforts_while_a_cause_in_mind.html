     <td>Lesson on1: don't mix arguments and disagreements. Things are already mixed and, lots of things are fucked up. Ops. Please excuse my language. The next dondon I want to say here , for the little dondons to be safe and secure, is the feeling of being secure or in other words not being unsecure. Now I'm suppressed, because I just had a very good reason to go on a trip to San Francisco, and stay out in the streets for an unlimited trip, but my dear said, should wouldn't take it with me! No complains, I had asked for a veto action to keep her decision open just in case it was closed out of rush, or with force. There I go. Now, I'm happy. And still hungry.

<p>Spacecraft taking off upon respect to a paragraph. Hey. Wait. Seriously, you are seting that to be a kind of a type that comes from the kind of many others that are named after the name of a kind. or a type. Yea, I'm confused. The spacecraft was apparently only showing respect to a paragraph. Excuseme sir or maam or sir or maam, you are being absused here. I feel bad. I'm sorry those are called `valedein` in school, meaning `parents, when I was a kid. You know what, I had a boghz.</p>
Alright, let's hide it. I mean let's talk about the part that aren't we supposed to be one? Either one of me or my question is understood differently? Let's go out? hey btw why is it that if I ask him or her or him or her to be known, and abused, or to stay inside for example an apartment, one is then in the danger of being known as a sexually harraser but if I ask him or her to go outside or at least stay outside , wait, are we fucking in the danger of being know as sexually harraser people?
<br/>
I just got a , or two mistakes in me and my teaching methods. Implementation has a mistake(other than these I mean those that I said earlier)):) too. Some iranian kids(toddlers?) call sparrows `tootoos`. Thanks to Shameless. I mean special thanks, and an apology. And a boos boos.<br/>We must , and we are a less-than-too-complicated we, explain what is what. Three words make a crowd. Tail looks like a tail now. Was-tail then looked like a face who let me into the world of animals-dreams-animals-dreams.
<br/><br/>Lesson th3, some lessons, I mean a lesson, a special (both was and got-more special) lesson, wasn't written because when S and H accompony a sound might+would be created.<br/>Lesson 4 is the topic of two times two is or is not four. I'll be now telling you a memory. There was a library in our middle school in my hometown where I think is the first time I was introduced to fractals. I remember the kind, familiar-relative-like librarian as well. But I don't remember how many was the number of dimensions of that fractal example or example fractal? That article. That magazine. Do you remember? Are our memories connected? Should I even be asking questions here? Are you asking questions? How rightful am I to ask questions?
<br/>
<br/>How rightful am I to ask that question? Again how rightful am I to ask this question? Leave my questions alone. No answer them if you like, if you would, but to be honest, I'm afraid for the formation(or body?) of each one to be treated other than kindly+with-care-or-with-care+kindly. I was all worried if I was presuming that there was a one trying to harm question and question. I promise I was.<br/>
I don't know who, just now, I don't know I was with or in or in-or-with it/them/us?! was affected in that happenned that happenned that a few sentences where removed and I couldn't undo that.
<br/>Time is 2:15am.<br/>Blue skys now is night. Yeah, offcourse, it's A M. Boom boom boom. Yeah. Please. \\you sick baby?//\\because I don't want anyone get hurmed at all.harm or hurted./i/
<br/><br/>
So please let me introduce myself. No I thought he was warning me of a mistake. I am called Jamshid Esmaelnezhad. I mean my name is Jamsheed Esmaelnezhad.
<br/>
What I'm doing here is building, I guess it's building, something, I guess, that works+a-adverb-thanks-to-adverbs-for-their-being . OK, just this time, or maybe later as well, or even better, or etc.: I wanted to say works magically, miraculusly, , if we really have to use a label, , let's not use a label. But let's think about that adverb. No, I was just trying to say or suggest that if our minds want to look for more adverb-label=label-adverb ID-tools we help them be free. And happy. But free. My friend, did you notice that I was thinking of our minds like a crowd of us but not me or and or and you?
<br/>
<br/>
I have what I think others call picture memory. I donno if the memory is in me, or in my-mind(which could be maayyndY using arabic language, including grammer, and the act of connecting two sets of characters) or in my think. Do you remember how lesson on1 was written? Oh wait, lesson bew, I just asked an indirect(a indirect) question about rememberance. The rememberance.
<br/>Are you ready for a question? I mean if you are ready answer it actually. It's heavy. At least this feels heavy to me. I feel that somefeels this heavy. Oh question. Nevermind. I'm disappointing you, but know that it took me long to write  Nevermind. after I had written the . after question.<br/><br/>OK OK coming back after doing a little bit of free, crazyish, research. I thought of this question: is inflation a good point to start directly thinking about that cause? But this was actually before I left to do research. The word that came to my mind in beginning was in Farsi `rokood` which I thought was inflation. But after some research, and some more research, and more writing btw, and more research , I think I say stagnation. In my research, I saw three things too: stagnation, economical stagnation, and market(baazaar) stagnation.hey! it was my fault that I didn't use a farsi-to-english translator earlier..
<br/>Time is 5:28am Monday December 25 is.
<br/>From my view, I don't know. btw. I say I don't know sometimes. So see, Jamsheed, you are afraid of , no don't want to , no who am I to , no don't agree to , to judge and act of continueing by motivated being from judgment( a word, a meaning, that I don't understand yet ). <br/><br/>boos boos. I mean it. I'm tired tho a real little something for you, I don't know.
<br/><br/>Oh, btw, time is 1:26pm.
<br/>I just remembered, tried-to-see+felt, broke. Nice. Thank you Thank you. Dondon.

<br/>oh btw, I just remembered two things and thta I don't remember those two things and also understood, madar , the last that I typed I one time understood it like ostadam boode oon naboode, and I just understood I , I had this worry from the beginning, madar don don let me not finish this sentence. Because I just learned something. oh oh I don't remember what that was. Madar jan I wanna dance for me. Yes.Yes, Yes. Yes. He's gone crazy..... .  . .  .   .   . .     .   .   .   .  .  . . Madar , (see here I think I'm or my soo(direction) of my view-attention is towards Madar sorry sorry sorry o-different-kind-of-o-something-between-oh-and-ow-but-not-sure , Madar don't eat unhappyness. Is it ? ? Boos boos.
<br/>If what I guess realized(but wanted to say understood first) was true, OK let's think about it a littlbe itbit. Pleas. OK, sorry...............................................................in typing these .s I was decided not to stop times and in thinking so sorry so sorry I'm sorry about  I was decided not stop times  I thought I was so careful about the things that I was thinking I was hiding or not. OK. no this one is Okey. So whoever    you are may have realized by now that I may call you don don.
<br/>Hey, o, I don't like lessons about identity. To be honest. No nothing specific to yoU llessonszz. So this was is apparently is gaurd and a gaurd and I meant some extra gaurding , mchchch , and I just felt proud, that kind that I fear, in meeee. No offense to proud. Or I , , OK I I don't knpw the people.

At least them. I got it. Are you careful? Sorry if I gave instread of you-or-our-relation without asking.

<br/>First, I want to tell you how dream-floating-dimmed-meaning-basi-that-looks-no-like-another-guard , good, dreamy, nice, etc. it was to know you. And share a purpose with you. At least that's what I feel-think. A cause. That cause too. Second, I love-no-not-sure-that-s-called-love-that-s-related-to-a-mathematician-that_I-know. Wow. A new lesson. Be careful of our speed. The pilot. The spacecraft? I remember a cause, again, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and again again. See, we have prepared, I'm assuming I was preparing for it too, for war so much that now I'm tired of thinking and trying tonottothinkaboutitnokhodsia(blackpeagofinditchildparentsmaysendthekidtohidesomethingfromthey)
<br/><p>I leaved here, here, this home, apartment, you name it, I slept here many nights, and evenings, and the door opens with no need-to-do-forced-sometimes-hopeless-thinking when I go out, and the key, as we lived it, used to rest under doormat(or I am saying it so+ly to free myself from the rtroubles of revealing the sharp looking truth.which explains  to rest  that I felt I may have used it in a forcely-uimitor-kinda-I-mean-no-I-meant-I-could-have-said-it-wrongly-even-then. He doesn't like using a sharp , leave those alone. (HEY I'm not, and I don't want to harm you, I promise) I want to sing for you, here, or anywhere else when your dondon is dondon. Oh another , he asked me to tell you, nevermind
<br/>

<br/><br/>Huh? See. I lived here.which is there. No fear my dear, my whoever, no fear<br/>so sometimes, it is , good-relaxing-releaving-Idonno , to , explain.
<br/>I remember now, I thought about a machine-which-I-call_a-machine_-because I have gears in my picture memory I mean I see, and have seen before a number of times, gears. When I see them I see revolution as well. As well as us working like a Watch to move particles of food-(Ithink food, and I wasn't sure about bringing to connect ( to dfromfood.) .
<span>I want to try something. I felt worried about our stories. I would be judging this if I sould that. With respect, deep respect, to English, as a language. As my second language,without which I couldn't have-write-agreed-to-before my first language(that time I agreed my language I think I m not sure).<p>I want to tell the story of . -> > from there to there. . was called Jamsheed Es. . had a dick.He went in heart of problems thats what others say.

<br/>okey, cut, should I start from beginning or after?
<br/>Jamsheed Es understood-agreed to that . was floating, miraciously-magically-christmassi, from where to where. Understood that. Yeah.
